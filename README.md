England & Wales Crime Dashboard
===============================

showing England & Wales crime statistics. Built using Python, Flask and
Plotly. https://data.police.uk/data/Arrests by ethnicity \#\# Overview
Our resuktd displays crime statistics in England & Wales. The
application was developed using the following architecture:

-   Backend: Python (Flask framework)
-   Frontend: HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Plotly and Bootstrap
-   Deployment: Heroku

A CRISP-DM methodology will be followed and detailed here at a later
stage of the project. \#\# Project Motivation The project was being
completed as part of the portfolio excercises for the Udacity Data
Science Nanodegree. The portfolio excercise requires the student to
develop a data-driven web application by making use of the Flask web
framework and Plotly. \#\# Data Source The data is being sourced from
https://data.police.uk/data/. This website contains open-source UK
gorvernment data. The dataset that is used within the web app is
centered on arrest statistics in England & Wales.

The latest available data is made available in the application via a
`requests` call to Arrests by ethnicity dataset.
